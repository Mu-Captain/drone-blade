3D Print new blades for drones/helicopters

This is a .scad file meant to be used with OpenScad.  To make .stl files to be used with a 3d printer.
I didn't indent any of the code because it's hard to see the code and viewer at the same time.
This is a template to make your life easier.  The viewer in OpenScad can be glitchy using "if" statement.
So if you like the option I would just remove the if statement all together, instead of just setting it to true.

If you want a prettier individual blade.  Alter the last cube in the file.
Last thing if you want the opposite direction of airflow of the blade/blades.  Give the pitch a negative.
